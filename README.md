# Attendance-System-FaceRecognition

Here I tried to build a Face Recognition System(FRS) on Raspberry Pi using OpenCV, PIL etc. Nowadays running a FR Model on PC's is easy due to the available of GPU's. But when running them on IOT and Mobile Devices, one has to overcome a lot of exceptions. 
In this repo, I will try to explain most of the components related to Face Recognition. I'll be updating this repo everyday...
So stay tuned!
