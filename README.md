# Attendance-System-FaceRecognition

Here I tried to build a Face Recognition System(FRS) on Raspberry Pi using OpenCV, PIL etc. Nowadays running a FR Model on PC's is easy due to the available of GPU's. But when running them on IOT and Mobile Devices, one has to overcome a lot of exceptions.

***Project Specifications:**

*Programming Language: Python 3.7
*Database: sqlite3
*Camera: Raspberry PI Camera Module
 
Using OpenCV library, I have detected face/s in video frame. For Face Recognition, I have used a Python library called as face_recognition. You can find its repo here.

In this repo, I will try to explain most of the components related to Face Recognition. I'll be updating this repo everyday...
So stay tuned!
